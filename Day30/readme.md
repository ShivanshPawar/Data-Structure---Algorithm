## 🔁 For Loop Practice


<details>
<summary><strong>Q17: Print "Hello World" n Times</strong></summary>

### 🧾 Concept:

Repeat a task (printing a message) a specific number of times using a `for` loop.

### 💡 Goal:

* Accept an integer `n` as input.
* Print `"Hello World"` exactly `n` times.

### 🧠 Learning:

* How to use a loop for repetition.
* Loop control with a counter variable.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q18: Print Natural Numbers Up to n</strong></summary>

### 🧾 Concept:

Natural numbers are positive integers starting from 1.

### 💡 Goal:

* Accept `n` from the user.
* Print numbers from 1 to `n`.

### 🧠 Learning:

* Basics of counting with `for` loops.
* Input/output with sequential logic.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q19: Print Numbers in Reverse (n to 1)</strong></summary>

### 🧾 Concept:

Using a `for` loop in reverse by decrementing the counter.

### 💡 Goal:

* Accept `n` from user.
* Print numbers from `n` down to 1.

### 🧠 Learning:

* Reverse loop logic.
* Proper use of loop conditions and updates.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q20: Print Multiplication Table of a Number</strong></summary>

### 🧾 Concept:

Print the table of a given number using multiplication inside a loop.

#### 📌 Example:

```
Input: 5
Output:
5 * 1 = 5
5 * 2 = 10
...
5 * 10 = 50
```

### 💡 Goal:

* Accept a number.
* Use a loop to display its table from 1 to 10.

### 🧠 Learning:

* Loop with calculations.
* Dynamic string output based on logic.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q21: Sum of Numbers Up to n</strong></summary>

### 🧾 Concept:

Add all numbers from 1 to `n` using a loop.

### 💡 Goal:

* Calculate sum: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n.

### 🧠 Learning:

* Accumulator variable pattern in loops.
* Mathematical series sum logic.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>Q22: Factorial of a Number</strong></summary>

### 🧾 Concept:

The factorial of a number `n` is the product of all positive integers ≤ `n`.

#### 📌 Example:

```
5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
```

### 💡 Goal:

* Accept number `n`.
* Calculate `n!` using loop.

### 🧠 Learning:

* Loop-based multiplication.
* Handling large results with iterative logic.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q23: Sum of Even & Odd Numbers in a Range</strong></summary>

### 🧾 Concept:

Identify and separate even and odd numbers and sum them independently.

### 💡 Goal:

* Accept range (`start` to `end`).
* Use conditions to split and sum even and odd numbers.

### 🧠 Learning:

* Conditional logic inside loops.
* Use of `if (i % 2 === 0)` to classify.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>Q24: Print All Factors of a Number</strong></summary>

### 🧾 Concept:

Factors of a number are values that divide it without a remainder.

### 💡 Goal:

* Accept `n` as input.
* Print all values `i` where `n % i == 0`.

### 🧠 Learning:

* Use of modulus `%` in divisibility.
* Loop-based divisor checking.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>Q25: Prime Number Check</strong></summary>

### 🧾 Concept:

A number is prime if it's divisible only by 1 and itself.

### 💡 Goal:

* Accept a number.
* Check if it's prime using divisor loop from 2 to `n - 1`.

### 🧠 Learning:

* Logic optimization (loop till `√n`).
* Composite vs prime recognition.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>Q26: Calculate Power (a<sup>b</sup>)</strong></summary>

### 🧾 Concept:

Raise a number `a` to the power of `b` using iterative multiplication.

#### 📌 Example:

```
Input: a = 2, b = 5 → Output: 2^5 = 32
```

### 💡 Goal:

* Accept two integers: base `a` and exponent `b`.
* Multiply `a` by itself `b` times.

### 🧠 Learning:

* Loop-controlled calculations.
* Exponentiation through repetition.
